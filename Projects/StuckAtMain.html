            Stuck at Main is a hidden object game made in GameMaker Studio. The main goal of the game is to find all of the keys placed inside the building.
            <br> When the keys are found on a specific floor, the player can go to the next floor.
            However, Old Main is in a dark place and the player must navigate through the rooms using a flashlight.
            <br> This project was made using gml, which is gamemaker's own language that creates most of the games in gamemaker studio.
