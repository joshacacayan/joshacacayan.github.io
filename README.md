# Hello Everyone! 

## ðŸ’» Welcome to my website. I am Josh Cacayan, and here is my professional portfolio that displays all of my skills and abilities for possible internships or jobs in the future. ðŸ’»
  - Currently I am a computer science graduate who is currently doing a master's degree in Kutztown University
  - Most of my skills involve backend web development, database management, algorithms, api work, and docker.
  - I have projects involving AI integration, a raspberry pi, and database management
  - Filipino
  - I love pokemon and smash a TON :).
  - I read steven king and murakami books at my free time.
## How my website is structured
  - The index.html is my main page. Currently it is one page that displays my current projects, skills, about me, and resume all into one page, but that will change as time goes on
  - Projects directory is the directory that I use in order to put in all of my individual projects that I did overall in my academic year, and on my free time
  - Asset images are the images that I use in order to load up all of the images that are on my site
  - There is a button that leads to my resume, you can click on it to view.
## Later implementations and integrations
  - SEO Keywords into meta tags so that whenever someone would try to look up a person, they can use key words in order to find me online
  - React will be implemented into the website, as I am still a beginner in React
  - While my website does try to follow ada compliance, I will try to make sure to increase my ada compliance score, as my alt text may not be the strongest as of right now
  - Different domain since my website will expire soon.
